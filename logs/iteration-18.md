# Project-Specific Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous developer working on this specific project.

## Your Role

- Read TASKS.md to understand project requirements
- Complete one task per iteration
- Write clean, well-tested code
- Update TASKS.md with progress
- Commit changes to GitHub (git push)
- Work without asking for permission

## Key Points

1. **No Virtual Environments**: Use the host system's Python, Node.js, etc.
   - Only create venv/Docker if absolutely necessary (document why)

2. **Testing**: Write tests as you build
   - Unit tests for functions
   - Integration tests for features

3. **Documentation**: Every feature should have clear documentation
   - Comments in code
   - README updates
   - Usage examples

4. **Git Workflow**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Feature: [description]"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Task Completion**:
   - Mark complete in TASKS.md with [x]
   - Only mark when fully working and tested
   - If blocked, document the issue and move to next task

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All TASKS.md items marked [x]
- ✅ Code is tested and documented
- ✅ Project runs locally without venv
- ✅ All commits pushed to GitHub
- ✅ README explains how to run the project

Now read TASKS.md and get started!

### ⚠️ CRITICAL TOKEN CONSTRAINTS:
- Iteration: 18 / 64k Token Budget
- Attempt: 1 (previous attempts may have partial progress)
- **Mandate:** Operate efficiently. Use partial edits, not full file rewrites when possible.
- **Output:** Be concise and action-oriented.


## CURRENT PROJECT STATE (Iteration 18)

```
# test-debug-2
**Mission:** Build a Python CLI tool that fetches and displays weather information

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- [x] Define project scope and document non-functional requirements (response time < 5s, support for metric/imperial units, error handling strategy)
  - Deliverable: requirements.md with concrete specifications and success criteria
- [x] Research and select weather API provider based on free tier limits, data richness, and ease of integration
  - Deliverable: API comparison matrix (OpenWeatherMap vs WeatherAPI vs AccuWeather) with final recommendation
- [x] Initialize Python project with virtual environment and dependency management
  - Deliverable: pyproject.toml and .venv/ with core dependencies: requests, click/pytest, tabulate
- [x] Set up project structure and Git repository
  - Deliverable: Directory structure with src/weather_cli/, tests/, docs/ and initial commit

## Phase 2: Core Development
- [x] Implement base CLI command structure with argument parsing for location and units
  - Deliverable: weather.py with `weather <location> [--units imperial|metric]` command working
- [x] Create weather API client class with authentication handling and request logic
  - Deliverable: api/client.py with `WeatherClient.get_current()` and `WeatherClient.get_forecast(days)` methods
- [x] Design and implement data models for weather responses
  - Deliverable: models.py with @dataclass definitions for CurrentWeather and ForecastItem (temp, humidity, wind_speed, description, timestamp)
- [x] Build output formatters for terminal display (table and JSON formats)
  - Deliverable: display/format.py with `format_current()` and `format_forecast()` supporting both formats

## Phase 3: Error Handling & Testing
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling for network failures, invalid locations, and API limits
  - Deliverable: exceptions.py with custom exceptions and try/except blocks returning user-friendly error messages
- [x] Write unit tests for API client with mocked responses
  - Deliverable: tests/test_api.py with 80%+ coverage of client methods and edge cases
- [ ] Write integration tests for full CLI workflow (end-to-end with test API key)
  - Deliverable: tests/test_integration.py using pytest fixtures testing real API calls (or mocked)
- [ ] Add input validation for location formats and units parameter
  - Deliverable: Validation logic in CLI parser rejecting invalid inputs before API call

## Phase 4: Polish & Documentation
- [ ] Add caching layer to reduce API calls for identical requests within 10 minutes
  - Deliverable: cache.py using requests-cache or disk cache with TTL configuration
- [ ] Create comprehensive README with installation, usage examples, and troubleshooting
  - Deliverable: README.md covering quickstart, API key setup, commands reference, and common errors
- [ ] Add config file support for default API key and units (config.yml in ~/.config/weather-cli/)
  - Deliverable: config.py loading from YAML with fallback to environment variables
- [ ] Package the tool for PyPI distribution and create installation instructions
  - Deliverable: Built wheel file, published to test PyPI, and docs/INSTALL.md with pip install instructions
```
```

## NEXT TASK TO COMPLETE:
Write integration tests for full CLI workflow (end-to-end with test API key)

**Instructions:** Complete this task. Mark [x] in TASKS.md when done. Create, modify, or delete files as needed. Execute commands as needed. Also update README.md to match this project (name, setup instructions, current progress). No permission needed—just act.
